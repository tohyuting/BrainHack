      <p>As of 2 June 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has preliminarily confirmed an additional 544 cases of COVID-19 infection in Singapore, the vast majority of whom are Work Permit holders residing in foreign worker dormitories. Based on our investigations so far, there are four cases in the community, of whom one is a Singaporean/Permanent Resident and three are Work Pass holders.</p>
      <br>
      <p>We are still working through the details of the cases, and further updates will be shared via the MOH press release that will be issued tonight.</p>

      <p>After an eight-week break, workers from a few essential infrastructure projects led by building solutions group ISOTeam will be returning to their work sites today.</p>
      <p>These projects have been given the go-ahead to restart on the first day after the circuit breaker, during which most works in the construction sector came to a halt.</p>
      <p>On top of getting workers to wear face masks and ensuring the use of the SafeEntry digital check-in system, stringent measures have been put in place.</p>
      <p>These include appointing a safe management officer to ensure that measures to guard against the spread of Covid-19 are in place, and establishing an evacuation plan at project sites for suspected Covid-19 cases, said Mr Anthony Koh, chief executive of ISOTeam.</p>
      <p>Critical and time-sensitive projects such as MRT works will be prioritised, but most construction work is unlikely to be able to resume so soon, said contractors.</p>
      <p>This is due to the numerous requirements that they need to fulfil in areas like housing for workers before they can restart work, which involve coordination among different employers and government agencies, they said yesterday.</p>
      <p>The Building and Construction Authority (BCA) has said it expects another 5 per cent of the construction workforce to gradually resume work this month, up from 5 per cent during the circuit breaker.</p>
      <p>Mr Eddy Lau, executive director of the Specialists Trade Alliance of Singapore, which represents more than 1,300 specialist contractors and suppliers in the building and construction industry, said most of its members are unlikely to be ready to start work today. He added that all the firms are trying their best to fulfil the safe management measures and restart criteria, including having workers tested for Covid-19.</p>
      <p>Mr V. Manimaran, operations manager of Wee Chwee Huat Scaffolding and Construction, said some of his firm's clients, who are main contractors, have received approval from BCA to restart projects in essential sectors like telecommunications. "They are chasing us to start work soon, but we still need to get swab tests done for our workers first," he said.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, the multi-ministry task force tackling the Covid-19 outbreak said an additional 28,000 workers have been cleared of the virus and can resume work, on top of about 12,000 essential workers already working during the circuit breaker. Singapore has about 320,000 foreign construction workers.</p>
      <p>Mr Hooi Yu Koh, chairman and chief executive of construction company Kori Holdings, said that while some of his clients are ready to resume work, his workers - some of whom are temporarily housed in hotels and cruise ships - need to first be rehoused into dormitory blocks that have been cleared of the virus before they can return to work.</p>
      <p>Mr Manimaran's firm has already started putting in place measures to comply with new Ministry of Manpower guidelines to ensure that workers can be isolated between their swab tests. Most will need to go through two tests and be isolated for 14 days in between the tests.</p>
      <p>Dormitories which fulfil the requirements will be given priority to have their workers tested first. These include furnishing rooms with single beds placed at least 1m apart, in groups of five, with each group separated by about 2m, where possible.</p>
      <p>Mr Manimaran's firm, which runs a dormitory for its workers, is meeting this requirement by limiting each bunk bed to one worker.</p>
      <p>His workers will be tested for Covid-19 today. If all goes well, the 40 to 50 workers on the four projects approved for resumption may be able to return to work in two or three weeks.</p>
      <p>"Up till a few weeks ago, we were unclear about the various requirements that we needed to fulfil. But there is clearer instruction now, and we have a better idea of how we can resume work," he said.</p>

      <br>
      <p>SINGAPORE: Amendments to the COVID-19 regulations, which were published in the Government Gazette just before they expired on Jun 2, mean the laws are now in force indefinitely and not just during the "circuit breaker" period.</p>
      <p>A host of other detailed amendments were published in a notice at 11.59pm on Jun 1, after the various ministries had announced new guidelines for the phases post-circuit breaker.</p>
      <p>The circuit breaker was a period between Apr 7 and May 4, later extended to Jun 1, meant to curb further spread of COVID-19 in Singapore.</p>
      <p>The COVID-19 regulations gave legal force to safe distancing and other such measures to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, to urge people to mask up and stay home unless absolutely necessary.</p>
      <p>Here is a list of some of the amendments published in the updated laws.</p>
      <p><strong>1. The Jun 1 end date was removed</strong></p>
      <p>One of the first amendments published late last night was for the phrase "for the period between 7 April 2020 and 1 June 2020 (both dates inclusive)" to be removed from the section explaining when the regulations are in force.</p>
      <p>Instead, it has been substituted with the words "starting 7 April 2020", with no end date specified.</p>
      <p><strong>2. What "member of same household" means</strong></p>
      <p>New paragraphs in the amendment now state specifically what "member of the same household" means.</p>
      <p>Previously, it was stated that meeting anyone from a different household except for specific exceptions is illegal under the regulations.</p>
      <p>A person is now regarded as a member of your household if they are your spouse, your parent, child, or sibling who ordinarily lives in the same house as you.</p>
      <p>Also, this now includes a person you have an agreement with, whether orally or in writing, expressly or implied, to live in the same residence.</p>
      <p>References to parents, grandparents, children, grandchildren, siblings also mean step-parents, step-grandparents, step-children, step-grandchildren, step-siblings, or adopted family members.</p>
      <p><strong>3. Visiting allowances</strong></p>
      <p>The amendments also reflect the new allowances for people to socialise with specific members of the family, as previously announced.</p>
      <p>Now, people are allowed to visit their parents, their grandparents, or their spouse's parents or grandparents.</p>
      <p>However, households cannot receive more than two visitors a day, and these two people must be from the same household themselves.</p>
      <p><strong>4. Social gatherings</strong></p>
      <p>Regulation 6, the regulation on social gatherings that previously made all forms of socialising outside of your household illegal, has also been amended.</p>
      <p>Now, a person must not meet another person not from their household anywhere outside of home unless it is for work.</p>
      <p>There are a few exceptions, such as for receiving education or care from a public body, a specified school or a licensed early childhood development centre.</p>
      <p><strong>5. When face shields may be worn in lieu of face masks</strong></p>
      <p>A person or child may wear a face shield instead of a face mask in the following scenarios:</p>
      <p>If wearing a mask in the required manner leads to severe medical conditions that wearing a face shield does not, or if the person is delivering a speech, teaching or lecturing in a lecture hall, classroom, auditorium or other room and is at least a metre away from any other individual while doing so.</p>
      <p><strong>6. Weddings and funerals post-circuit breaker</strong></p>
      <p>Weddings can be held but only the bride and groom and eight guests are allowed to attend in person.</p>
      <p>There are also specific rules for where it can be held - such as a place of worship, in the bride or groom's home or immediate family's home, or a building occupied by the Registries of Marriages or Muslim Marriages.</p>
      <p>People in charge at funeral events must take all reasonable steps to ensure that there are not more than 10 individuals attending the wake or event at any time. The usual safe distancing rules apply.</p>
      <p><strong>7. Businesses in phase 1</strong></p>
      <p>Shops and enterprises that have resumed business must abide by newly stated obligations, such as allowing natural ventilation of the premises during working hours, having procedures and controls for assessing every visitor or customer for symptoms and refusing entry to suspected symptomatic cases.</p><p>If people who enter the shops are symptomatic cases and not wearing a mask, the business must try its best to provide the individual with a mask and require them to wear it, and to ask them to leave immediately.</p><p>Common areas must be periodically cleaned each day by law, and toilets not open to the public must be provided at all times with adequate toilet paper, liquid soap or detergent, litter bins and clean towels or hand dryers.</p>
      <p>Disinfecting agents like hand sanitisers, disinfectant sprays, paper towels and wipes must also be provided at all times up to a point where it is reasonably practicable, for the free use of customers, visitors and employees.</p>
      <p><strong>8. Non-permitted enterprises and working from home</strong></p>
      <p>Anyone who is not a permitted enterprise worker cannot work anywhere other than from home, and only through means that do not require meeting any individual in person.</p>
      <p>Flouting any of these regulations can earn an offender up to six months' jail, a fine of up to S$10,000, or both for the first offence.</p>

        <p>Having good mental wellbeing helps us to deal with challenges, solve problems and achieve our goals. Maintaining good mental wellbeing also reduces our vulnerability to mental health difficulties and challenges in life. Here are seven easy tips for better mental wellbeing:</p>
        <br>
        <h3>1. Exercise Regularly</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Exercising releases “happy hormones” into your body. For instance, you can take the stairs instead of the lift.</p>

        <h3>2. Do More of What Makes You Happy</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Take a break to do what you enjoy can refresh you to better handle your problems.</p>

        <h3>3. Manage Your Time</h3>
        <p>Plan your time well so that you can complete your tasks on time. Break large tasks into smaller manageable parts.</p>
